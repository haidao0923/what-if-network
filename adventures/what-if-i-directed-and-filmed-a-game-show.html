                Have you ever liked a game show so much that you binge-watch all 18 seasons wishing for a chance to compete in them yourself? What if I transformed that wish into reality?
            </p>
            <p>
                Taskmaster is a gameshow that challenge 5 comedians to a series of collaborative and competitive tasks wherein at the conclusion of 10 episodes, the contestant with the most points by completing their tasks in the most innovative way is declared the winner and given a bust of the head of the taskmaster.
            </p>
            <p>
                I discovered the series on YouTube during my time studying at Georgia Institute of Technology and thought that it would be fun to recreate the show with my friends and so I set out to create props for the show.

                First, I created the familiar taskmaster envelope by printing the task description on cardstock papers. Next, I printed out promotional materials flyers to post around campus, and mini envelopes with the title of the club to distribute throughout Georgia Tech.

            <p>
                After making preliminary promotional materials, I booked a room on campus for a weekly meetup to watch the game show and created social media pages on Discord, Instagram, YouTube, and Linktree. In the meantime, I woodworked a jenga set out of 2x4 wood by using a combination of a large band saw and a miter saw, sanding the edges and engraving each individual pieces with letters using a laser engraver.

            <p>
                During our weekly meetings, we explored the resources available inside the room including a whiteboard, desks, projectors, and two built-in room camera with 360 degree recording. We filmed some of our meeting activities and after editing with DaVinci Resolve, we published the game show to YouTube!

                And let not forget the final prize of the Taskmaster show, a bust of the head of the Taskmaster, achieved through a mobile 3d-scan of my head and printed with ABS and resin.
